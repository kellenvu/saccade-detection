# saccade-detection

A custom threshold-based saccade detection algorithm that I wrote for the Raymond laboratory at Stanford.

# How to Use

Run saccadeDetection.mlapp in MATLAB.

Click `Folder`, and navigate to the folder that contains the Spike2 smr file (eye position) and the cali.mat file (calibration scale factor).

Click `Detect Saccades`.
